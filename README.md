1. Design a distributed application using RPC for remote computation where client submits an integer 
value to the server and server calculates factorial and returns the result to the client program.
2. Design a distributed application using RMI for remote computation where client submits two strings to 
the server and server returns the concatenation of the given strings.
3. Implement Union, Intersection, Complement and Difference operations on fuzzy sets. Also create 
fuzzy relations by Cartesian product of any two fuzzy sets and perform max-min composition on any 
two fuzzy relations.
4. Write code to simulate requests coming from clients and distribute them among the servers using the 
load balancing algorithms.
5. Optimization of genetic algorithm parameter in hybrid genetic algorithm-neural network modelling: 
Application to spray drying of coconut milk.
6. Implementation of Clonal selection algorithm using Python.
7. Implement DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms) using Python.
8. Design and develop a distributed Hotel booking application using Java RMI. A distributed 
hotel booking system consists of the hotel server and the client machines. The server 
manages hotel rooms booking information. A customer can invoke the following operations 
at his machine i) Book the room for the specific guest ii) Cancel the booking of a guest.
9. Design and develop a distributed application to find the coolest/hottest year from the 
available weather data. Use weather data from the Internet and process it using Map Reduce.
10. Implement Ant colony optimization by solving the Traveling salesman problem using 
python Problem statement- A salesman needs to visit a set of cities exactly once and 
return to the original city. The task is to find the shortest possible route that the salesman 
can take to visit all the cities and return to the starting city.
